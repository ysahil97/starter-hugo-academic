Hi! I am Sahil Yerawar. I have done my B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering from IIT-Hyderabad. I have worked in various projects related to Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Information Retrieval and Compilers in my undergraduate years and after graduation. I am interested to work on open-source projects and in research environments, both focused on core areas of Computer Science.

In my free time, I enjoy running, playing music, cooking and learning new languages on [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/profile/ysahil97).
